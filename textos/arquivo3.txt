Last night a little dancer, came dancing to my door
Last night a little angel, came pumping on my floor
She said, come on, baby, I got a license for love
And if it expires, pray help from above
Because

In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more, wow!
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell more, more, more
More! More! More!

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely, she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to me, babe?
What set you free? I need you here by me
Because

In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more, wow!
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell more, more, more

He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long it don't mess up his hair

Rowah! Ow!

I walked the world with you, babe
A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain, babe
A million times for you
I'd sell my soul for you, babe
For money to burn with you
I'd give you all, and have none, babe
Justa, justa, justa, just to have you here by me
Because

In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more, wow!
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
More! More! More!

Ooh yeah, little baby
She want more
More! More! More! More! More! (more, more)
Oh, yeah, little angel
She want more
More! More! More! More! More! (more, more)
