Finished with my woman 'cause she
Couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because
I am frowning all the time

All day long, I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't
Find something to pacify

Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Whoa, yeah

I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal

And so, as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late
