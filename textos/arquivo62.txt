Freezin', rests his head
On a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin', maybe he'll see
A little better set a days, ooh yeah

Oh, hand out, faces that he sees time again
Ain't that familiar, oh, yeah
Oh, dark grin, he can't help
When he's happy, looks insane
Oh, yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again

Kneelin', looking through the paper
Though he doesn't know to read, oh, yeah
Oh, prayin', now to something
That has never showed him anything, oh

Oh, feelin', understands the weather
Of the winter's on its way, oh
Oh, ceilings, few and far between
All the legal halls of shame, yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away, yeah!

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again, yeah
Oh, whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away, yeah!
