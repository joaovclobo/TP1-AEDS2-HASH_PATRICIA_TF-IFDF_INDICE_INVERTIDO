I saw her standin' on her front lawn
Just a-twirlin' her baton
Me and her went for a ride, sir
And ten innocent people died

From the town of Lincoln, Nebraska
With a sawed-off .410 on my lap
Through to the badlands of Wyoming
I killed everything in my path

I can't say that I'm sorry
For the things that we done
At least for a little while, sir
Me and her we had us some fun

The jury brought in a guilty verdict
And the judge, he sentenced me to death
Midnight in prision storeroom
With leather straps across my chest

Sheriff, when the man pulls
That switch, sir, and snaps my poor neck back
You make sure my pretty baby
Is sittin' right there on my lap

They declared me unfit to live
Said into that great void my soul'd be hurled
They wanted to know why I did what I did
Well sir, I guess there's just a meanness in this world
