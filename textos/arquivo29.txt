Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself in the mirror) take a look in the mirror and I cry (and I cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me?
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody (somebody)
Oh, somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard (he works hard) everyday of my life
I work 'till I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
(Goes home, goes home on his own)
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord
Somebody (somebody)
Oh, somebody (please)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(He wants help)

Every day (every day), I try, and I try, and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
No, I got no common sense
(He's got) I got nobody left to believe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(Anybody, find me someone to love)
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm ok, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
Ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Some day I'm gonna be free, Lord

Find me somebody to love, find me somebody to love

Somebody (find me)
Somebody, find me somebody to love
