Getting crazy on the waltzers
But it's the life that I choose
Yeah sing about the sixblade
Sing about the switchback
And a torture tattoo
And I been riding on a ghost train
Where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight
But I'd always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces
I seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races
Yeah just like me she was a victim of the night
I put my hand upon the lever
Said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever
There was an arrow through my heart and my soul
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah love
It's just the danger, danger
When you're riding at your own risk
She said, You are the perfect stranger
She said, Baby let's keep it like this
It's just a cake walk twisting baby
Yeah step right up and see
Hey mister give me two, give me two now
Cause any two can play
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Woah love
Well it's been money for muscle on another worthy gig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to, just to make it big
And rockaway, rockaway
Oh rockaway, rockaway
And girl it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Oh like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids
Yeah girl it looks so pretty to me
Just like it always did
Oh like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids
Check it out
She took off a silver locket
She said, "Remember me by this"
She put her hand in my pocket
I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel
I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough
But something must have made me stay
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on this world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah love, love, love
On the tunnel of love
Woah love, love
