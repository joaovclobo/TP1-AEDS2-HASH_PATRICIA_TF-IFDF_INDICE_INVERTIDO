When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle
Oh, it was beautiful, magical

And all the birds in the trees
Well they'd be singing so happily
Oh, joyfully
Oh, playfully, watching me

But then they sent me away
To teach me how to be sensible
Logical
Oh responsible, practical

And they showed me a world
Where I could be so dependable
Oh, clinical
Oh, intellectual, cynical

There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you, please, please, tell me what we've learned?
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am

Now watch what you say
Or they'll be calling you a radical
A liberal
Oh fanatical, criminal

Oh, won't you sign up your name?
We'd like to feel you're acceptable
Respectable
Oh presentable, a vegetable

But at night, when all the world's asleep
The questions run so deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please (won't you tell me?)
Please tell me what we've learned? (can you hear me?)
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am

Who I am
Who I am
Who I am
Who I am

'Cause I'm feeling so illogical
D-d-digital
One, two, three, four, five
Oh oh oh oh
Unbelievable
B-b-bloody marvelous
